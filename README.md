### Task
Set up a minimal version of the Snowman Meltdown game with just enough code to start the game loop. In this step, we’ll add functionality to snowman.py that:
- Greets the user.
- Selects a random secret word from a provided list.
- Contains an empty game loop that will later process guesses.

### What to Do:
- <strong>Run the game:</strong> Verify that the greeting appears, a secret word is selected (displayed for now), and that the program prompts for a letter.
- <strong>Commit Your Progress:</strong> Once you’ve verified this basic functionality, commit your changes with the appropriate message.
